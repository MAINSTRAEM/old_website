#### Rising Stars and the Henry Royce Institute: Stand Out Skills Webinar - Build your own academic website.

**Date:** 31 May 2023
**Time:** 10am-11am BST
**Location:** The internet!

Websites are a great way to promote yourself, your research, or other projects you participate in. Adapting one of the many freely available website templates allows you to build a personal brand and communicate effectively.

In this talk, Dr Lucy Whalley (Northumbria University) will walk you through how to set up a free, static (non-interactive) website using Github Pages and highlight some effective examples from materials science research.

#### Rising Stars in Materials Science Workshop

**Date:** Friday 13th January        
**Location:** The Henry Royce Institute, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.

Registration for this event has closed. 

This full day event will combine intensive career skills workshops, creative networking activities and a carefully selected Q & A panel of experts with recent successes in their career paths. Priority registration will be given to historically marginalised groups, and funding for travel and/or caring responsibilities are available to aid accessibility. 

This years participants will be invited to provide feedback to co-develop further events to ensure the relevance and usefulness of future activities. Overrall, the events aim to support researchers to not only work but to thrive in their research community, to address the diversity gap within STEM research, and to hence enhance the diversity of thought and innovation.
