Rising Stars has been created to celebrate and support the rising stars within underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Topics.

Our first event will be hosted in January 2023. It is targeted at Early Career Researchers (whether PhD student, post-doc or holding a permenant position) in Materials Science.
